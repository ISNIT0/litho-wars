# Intro #3: Arrays

arrays, collisions, picking random items

- arrays, iteration
- UW.range
- array of text
- UW.randomChoice
- UW.getFingers
- collisions Sprite.getTouching

## Console: Arrays

* array literals (of numbers)
* UW.range() TODO
* iteration

## Iteration

* make a sprite every N y positions.
* challenge (optional): make a grid of sprites

## Choosing random things

* text literals
* making lists of text
* UW.choose() for costumes ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ´ðŸŒµðŸŽ„
* fill the screen with random kinds of tree

## Collisions

* for other in getTouching()
* lets...burn the trees with fire
* on drag
* move fire to finger
* destroy any overlapping trees

## The end

Nice! Now you know about Javascript Arrays, how to get random numbers, how to pick an item from an Array at random, how to detect a finger being dragged, and how to get overlapping objects.
