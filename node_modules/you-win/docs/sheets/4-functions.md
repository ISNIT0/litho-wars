# Intro #4: Functions

Functions, scope, Promises, Sounds

**TODO**: consider forever().then() ?

- functions, scope
- Promises
- sounds [TODO!]

## Console

* define a square() function.
* terms: call, arguments

## Scope

* define a tree() function.
* Every function gets its own set of variables.
* forever; grow, perhaps?
* each call to tree() gets its own instance of the variables inside tree.

## Sounds

* init is really a Promise.
* .then means "do something after the Promise finishes."
* we can play Sounds...
* ...and wait until theyâ€™re done.
